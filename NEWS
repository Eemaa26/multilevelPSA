multilevelPSA 1.2
=========

* Added balance.plot function to create a plot of covariate effect sizes before

* The getPropensityScore method will also return strata.
* Added parameters to loess.plot to control the number of points to plot (as a sampling percentage) 
  as well as the transparency level.
* Changed minimum R requirement to 3.0 since some dependent packages require 3.0 (e.g. ggplot2)
